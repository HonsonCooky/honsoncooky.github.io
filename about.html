            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>
                I grew up doing musical theatre and music, which probably sounds weird for a Software Engineer. Honestly
                though, the overlap is bigger than you'd think - structure, timing, knowing when to improvise and when
                to follow the script. It also meant I got comfortable presenting and communicating early, which helps
                tremendously.
            </p>

                I was always more of a maths and science person though. I picked up programming in school and took it to
                university. The further I got into it - Operating Systems, Compilers, Networking - the more it just made
                sense. In my fourth year I built a <code>BLE</code> mesh network on <code>M5Stack</code> devices. That
                project stuck with me. Following low-level dictates, making calculated decisions on how the system came
                together - it aligned with how I think. It was difficult, but the satisfaction of seeing every layer
                click into place was something I hadn't felt in a long time. That's when I knew systems-level
                engineering was where I belonged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, most of my work has been building and maintaining production systems in
                <code>TypeScript</code> and <code>C#</code>. Specs, org workflows, the usual. I'm good at it, and it
                pays the bills. The stuff I actually get excited about is lower down though - systems-level programming,
                performance, how computers actually work under the hood. Right now that's <code>Go</code>. Eventually
                it'll be <code>Zig</code>.
